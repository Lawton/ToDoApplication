# ToDoApplication
Android application for a to do list.

This TODO application comes from my desire for an ability to put very simply todo list on my phone. I write todo list every morning so that I can remind myself what I need to get done. The features of this todo list are therefore based around my desire for relative simplicity.

The current implementations has a main list of items which can be selected and edited. Items can also be added using the "plus" button.


# Features to be included:
- calendar where each day can be selected with its own list of items
- easily add tasks to current day
- color code priority for tasks
- easily complete task (check mark tasks)
- once a task is complete it should drop in the priority list 
- ability to minimize task, group task together and default how tasks are grouped
- ability to add comments to task when complete - can access these comments and get more detail on task
- ability to set deadlines on tasks, if deadlines are missed the tasks can change priority level
- oush notifications when tasks reach their deadline
